Bureaucracy

Game Rules:

    Setup:
    - each player is dealt three factions cards and chooses to play as one of the factions
    - at the beginning of the game, each player gains one coin and recruits one troop
    - you are secretly assigned two players to eliminate - first player to accomplish their goal wins
        - make sure each player is targeted by exactly two others
            - one option - use app
            - second option - pass out cards, then have people who got their own cards get only those cards reassigned - give up info, but gain info too
            - third option - pass out cards - you can have yourself as one of the targets
            - fourth option - have a non-player assign the cards
    - bankrupt means you're eliminated

    Turns:
    Beginning of Turn:
    - gain one coin, plus one coin for each ally, and each ally gains a coin
    - flip the top card
    - may purchase troops (attackers or defenders) for 3 coins each
    - may reassign any number of troops as attackers or defenders
    Attack:
    - you may declare attacks on any number of players on your turn, but all attacks are simultaneous
    - any number of your attackers can be sent on each attack
    - a successful attack reduces the opponent's coins by one for each attacker.
    - when you declare an attack, any of your allies (excluding the attacked player) can veto the attack
    - if you attack an ally, you attack successfully - else you have to attack into their troops
        - defenders can't attack, and it takes two attackers to destroy a defender (both attackers are destroyed)
        - attackers can be used to defend (defending player's choice), but a single attacker will destroy two of them
    - an attacked player's allies can send any number of their own troops to help defend
    - a player's allies can give them any number of their own coins at any time
    - after being attacked successfully, a player may break or form alliances
    End of Turn:
    - may purchase troops for 3 coins each
    - choose to form or break alliances with any number of other players - breaking can be unilateral, but forming requires agreement

    Winning the Game:
    - you win the game when both of your targets are eliminated
    - if two or more players would win at the same time, the player whose turn it is wins - if it's none of those players' turns, then they have a draw

    Misc:
    - if there is more than one law in play, all except the newest law are repealed
    - when voting, all players reveal their votes simultaneously
    - elimination targets are based on players - if a player changes factions, their targets do not change and other players who have them as a target still have them as a target
    - if a player is reequired to attack, they must assign a sufficient number of troops as attackers if possible, and initiate an attack if they have enough troops - actions, motions, and laws may make it impossible for an attack to occur
